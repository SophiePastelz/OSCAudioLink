* Backend optimizations
* Switched from using json to yaml format entirely
* Added a menu for when your config file is broken or incomatible
* * It will attempt to tell you why the config file is broken
* * it will give you 2 choices reset config or open config file (to manually fix it)
* * * The program will resume once the config file has been restored to a working order

### `Main`
* Made `export all` button only allow .yaml file to be exported and imported

### `Config file`
* Switched the save file format to .yaml instead of json

# Note
* Your old config file will most likely no longer work with this version
